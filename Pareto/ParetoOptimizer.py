'''ParetoOptimizer contains the main system of Pareto front based decision making for Multi-objective aerodynamic optimization'''

'''
1. Initial design
2. Objective function evaluations
3. Identify non-dominated points
4. Fit RBF surrogate models to the data
5. Select sample point on the basis of the two former steps
    - Decision beteen global and local search
    - Back to step 2'''


import
#Import initial dataset

#If necessary do objective function evaluations for the initial dataset

#Identify non-dominated points

#Use RBF to find estimate the new intials

#Make decision of which points to evaluate
