    "### Domain Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding optimal solutions in Mechanical Engineering requires thorough theoretical understanding of physics and practical experience in the domain to find good solutions. However, even skilled professionals experiment with a number of theories before finding the most suitable solution. Machine Learning algorithms can be used to find hidden patterns and automate the engineering process. Genetic Algorithms have already proven useful - proposing technical solutions, which humans would probably not find with human intuition. A great example of this is the design of a NASA satellite antenna: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1244h/1244%20(Hornby).pdf. An examples of applying Machine Learning is [Simulation Data Mining](http://www.joerg.frochte.de/field-of-interest/simulation-data-mining/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I am currently designing a Blended Wing Body Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and am interested in experimenting with Machine Learning algorithms to help make the solvers more \"intelligent\" to speed up the development process. Handing tasks that can be automated and are based on a lot of \"trial and error\" is a significant improvement of an engineers workflow. However, physics simulation driven policies can act in other applications as well, such as [real-time decision making](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Tedrake09.pdf). The policy will be using open-source softwares to generate geometry and get evaluations for the proposed geometries: [XFLR5](http://www.xflr5.com/xflr5.htm), [XFoil](http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/), [OpenVSP](http://openvsp.org/) and [AeroPython](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/announcing-aeropython/)."
